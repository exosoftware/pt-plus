=======================
Portugal - Website Sale
=======================

This module is designed to enhance your e-commerce platform's adherence to
Portugal's tax laws. It prevents the listing of products without proper tax
information, ensuring compliance and reducing legal risks.

It also safeguards against errors that may occur when a user completes
a payment but doesn't receive the product due to missing tax information
in the backoffice.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module will NOT perform any check on installation. Being so, any inconsistent tax setup
will NOT be detected. That is why we advise you to unpublish all products before activating
this module. This way the system will run the necessary tax verification checks upon
product publishing.
