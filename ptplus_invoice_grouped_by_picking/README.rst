Portugal - Invoice grouped by picking
=====================================

A custom portuguese version of the account_invoice_report_grouped_by_picking
module. The main difference is that negative lines are not allowed in the
invoice report. Instead a new column is computed in order to show the moved
quantities (which can be negative).


Installation
============

Just do it.
