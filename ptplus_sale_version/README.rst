Portugal - Versions for sale orders and quotations
==================================================

This module is the Portuguese version of the *sale_order_revision* OCA module.
The difference is that Portuguese quotations and orders must keep a unique and
sequencial serial number and so the revision numbering and logic is performed
on a specific field (Internal Number) instead of using the regular document
number.
